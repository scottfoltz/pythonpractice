# Python Practice

Collection of a few small python projects that I did for fun

## Getting Started

Each file is a separate program. Moving forward I will give a description for each project

### Projects

1. football.py - simulates a single possession in college football overtime
2. paint_silva.py - paint cost calculator that grabs dimensions of a room and calculates how much it will cost to paint a room
3. password-gen - takes in a text file and generates a random password using the words in the file (wordlist.txt)
4. rock-paper-sc - program that simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors that the user can play against the computer
5. text-analyzer - takes in a text file and calculates the number of lines, words, sentences, punctuation, consonants, and vowels. (test.txt)
6. turtle-race - simulates a race between two turtles. one turtle randomly moves across, while the other takes in coordinates from a file (coordinates.txt)
