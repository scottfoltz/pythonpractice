Welcome to the home page of the Lewis University Mathematics
and Computer Science Department (LUMaCS). These are exciting
times to be a Math or Computer Science major, particularly at
Lewis. Every day, new technologies are being developed that
were created by computer scientists like our students. Some
of these technologies may fundamentally change how we work,
play, and communicate. And all of these technologies function
based on the laws of math. Few other majors can boast the
opportunity to transform the world the way Computer Science
can, and few other majors enable you to understand those
transformative forces the way Mathematics can. At Lewis, we
are looking for ways to bring that potential to fruition,
preparing students to be tomorrow's computer innovators and
problem solvers. Click here to view a brief slide presentation
on why you should become a Computer Science or Mathematics
Major at Lewis.
